The potato is a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum and is a root
vegetable native to the Americas. The plant is a perennial in the nightshade
family Solanaceae.
Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas, from Canada to
southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated
by Native Americans independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic
studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and
extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there approximately
7,000â€“10,000 years ago, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex.
In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some
close relatives of the potato are cultivated.
